# Welcome to My Notebook

Hi, I’m **Luigi Mari** — a **mechanical engineer** with a growing focus on **data science** and **quantitative finance**.  

This notebook is where I combine **engineering discipline** with **financial modeling** — exploring how data, math, and algorithms can be used to understand and trade financial markets.  

Here, you’ll find a mix of **experiments**, **prototypes**, and **research notes** — from **systematic trading strategies** and **risk models**, to **data pipelines** and **simulation tools** built in Python.  

I’m especially interested in the intersection of **mathematics, computation, and market behavior**, and in how quantitative methods can bridge theory and real-world decision-making.  

## Contents

1. **Trading systems** — strategy design and backtesting  
2. **Derivatives & risk** — pricing models and hedging simulations  
3. **Data engineering for finance** — pipelines and time-series analysis  
4. **Quant research tools** — experiments and explorations
