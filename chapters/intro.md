Welcome to my notebook!  
**Luigi Mari â€” Mechanical Engineer - Data Scientist**

In this space, youâ€™ll find some of my notes, experiments, and research focused on the fields that fascinate me the most: **trading**, **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **engineering**.  

My goal is to explore how quantitative methods, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking can be applied to financial markets â€” from **systematic trading strategies** and **risk modeling** to **portfolio optimization** and **derivatives pricing**.  

This repository is a personal collection of ideas Iâ€™ve been studying and developing over the years, aimed at understanding how **math and engineering principles** can interact to build smarter, more efficient approaches to complex financial problems.

## Topics youâ€™ll find here

1. Quantitative trading strategies and backtests  
2. Mathematical and statistical modeling for finance  
3. Engineering approaches to data pipelines and time-series processing  
4. Notes, experiments, and research projects combining all the above ðŸš€
